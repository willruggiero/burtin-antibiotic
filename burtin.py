In the golden age of antibiotics, one truth remains unchanged: **no single drug works for everything**. Burtin's dataset comparing three antibiotics against 16 bacterial species uncovers this reality with stunning clarity.

Each antibiotic ‚Äî **Penicillin**, **Streptomycin**, and **Neomycin** ‚Äî offers a unique pattern of effectiveness. When examined together, we see why doctors often hesitate before prescribing ‚Äî because bacterial identity and cell wall structure make all the difference.

### üéØ Key Insights:

- Penicillin is incredibly effective against *Bacillus anthracis* and *Staphylococcus aureus* ‚Äî both Gram-positive.
- It is virtually useless against *Aerobacter aerogenes* and *E. coli*.
- Streptomycin and Neomycin offer more reliable performance across species, but even they struggle with some *Streptococcus* strains.

In short: treating infections isn't just about using ‚Äúan antibiotic.‚Äù It's about choosing **the right one** ‚Äî and data like this saves lives by helping us make better decisions.
